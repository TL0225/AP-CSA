# AP-CSA

The following contains all programs created during an AP Computer Science A course from the years of 2021-2022.

 _AP Computer Science A is equivalent to a first-semester, college-level course in computer science._

**Programs from 2021:**
[Two Dimensional Array](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/TwoDimensionalScanner.java) - Using a 4 by 4 array matrix to find and display the sum of all the rows and the sum of the column. 

[Integer Array](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/GFM.java) - Takes letter grades and converts said letter grade into how much money a person will recieve for that grade.

[Investment](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/Investment.java) - Uses the formula I = PRT to display total amount through the addition of starting amount and the interest.

[Lawn](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/Lawn2.java) - Program that involves writing a lawn mowing program for a season. Factors included: Length, Width, how often a person would pay and prints total fee and payment.

[ComputeNet](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/ComputeNet.java) - Finds Gross pay from hourly payrate and number of hours worked per day. Determines Withholding percentage based on grosspay.

[Circle](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/tree/main/src/Circle) - Two classes consisting of setters/getters to find the radius, diameter and area of a circle.

[Dollars](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/Dollars.java) - A program that calculates the and displays the conversion of $57 into dollar bills from 20, 10,5,1. it should display how many 20 dollars, how many $10, how many $5 and how many $1 bills are in 57 dollars.

[TestMethods](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/TestMethods.java) - Program consisting of multiple methods that takes a value and displays the value, value times 2, and value plus 100.

[Eggs](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/Eggs.java) - Program that takes number of eggs to find how many dozens of eggs you have and how many left remainding

[SearchArray](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/SearchArray.java) - Program that compares an integer input to a every element in an array of 10 or more integers. When there is a match the program produces an output indicating there is a match and if there is no match it will say there is no match.

[Grades](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/Grades.java) - Program that prints the corresponding letter grade per the range of numbers that is associated for that letter grade.

[ClassworkA](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/ClassWorkA.java) - Program using an array w/ scanner function that find the product of the ages of the peopel in a family

[ProblemSet8](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/ProblemSet8.java) - Program that uses an inputted array of numbers and checks for even numbers and add only the even numbrs in the list, printing out the sum of the even numbers

[ProblemSet7](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/ProblemSet7.java)- A program using a for loop, that prints and adds all multiples of 5

[Tennis](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/Tennis.java) - Program that determines whether a person can play tennis with the preconditions that the weather isn't raining and the temperature must be greater than 65 and less than 95 degrees.

[SimpleInterest](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/Project2/SimpleInterest.java) - Program that takes the interest earned and returns it to the main class from the method. 

[Yard](https://github.com/TL0225/AP-CSA/blob/main/src/Project2/Yard.java) - Program that takes the length and width to find area and returns area back to the main class.
